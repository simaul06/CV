            <h2>INTRO</h2>
            <h3><b>Minato Namikaze — The Yellow Flash of the Leaf</b></h3>
            Minato Namikaze was a legendary shinobi from Konohagakure, best known as the Fourth Hokage and the father of
            Naruto Uzumaki. Renowned for his incredible speed and mastery of the Flying Thunder God Technique (Hiraishin
            no Jutsu), Minato earned the nickname "Konoha’s Yellow Flash" for his lightning-fast teleportation in
            battle.

            A genius from a young age, Minato graduated from the Ninja Academy with top honors and quickly rose through
            the ranks with unmatched skill and a calm, strategic mind. He was the creator of the Rasengan, a powerful
            spinning chakra technique later mastered by his son, Naruto.

            Despite his calm demeanor, Minato was fearless in battle, and his leadership during the Third Great Ninja
            War turned the tide in Konoha’s favor. His most heroic moment came when he sacrificed his life to save the
            village from the Nine-Tails attack, sealing the beast into his newborn son—an act that defined Naruto’s
            fate.

                        <li><b>Reputation:</b> His use of the Flying Thunder God Technique allowed him to teleport and
                            eliminate
                            enemy

                        <li><b>Impact:</b> Villages like Iwagakure gave standing orders to flee on sight if they
                            encountered
                            Minato.
                            That level of fear speaks volumes about his threat level.</li>

                        <li><b>Notable Feat:</b> Single-handedly defeated an entire platoon of Hidden Stone ninja using
                            speed and

                        <li>Minato created the Rasengan, a powerful A-rank jutsu using chakra control alone (no hand

                        <li>Though he never got to combine it with his nature transformation, the technique became a

                        <li>Though unfinished in his lifetime (he couldn't combine it with his nature transformation),
                            it became the foundation for:
